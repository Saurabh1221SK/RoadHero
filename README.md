# RoadHero

**RoadHero** is a web-based application that allows users to capture images of traffic violations, report them, and provide relevant details such as vehicle number, violations, location, and bank account details for a reward. This project leverages Streamlit for the frontend, OpenCV for image processing, and allows real-time timestamp application on images.

## Features

- Capture images with timestamp using your deviceâ€™s camera.
- Input vehicle number and select traffic violations.
- Enter location via pincode.
- Submit bank account details for reward purposes.
- Provide an option for submitting the report with complete details.
- Reward for valid reports of violations based on the submission.

## How to Use

1. **Capture Image**: Click on the "Take a picture" button to capture a photo of the traffic violation.
